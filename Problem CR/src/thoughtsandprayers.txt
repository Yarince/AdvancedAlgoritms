1.  Get triple that is balanced
2.  Add the first available next molecule to the triple to create the first
    group
3.  Check if every triple in the group is still balanced
    - If not: Remove the last added molecule continue at step (2)
    - If yes: Save the group and continue at step (2)
4. If all the combinations are made with the beginning triple are made go to
    the next start triple and continue at step (1)


Repeat until all possible combinations are made. Take the biggest



Should remember which combo's don't work and only test the next ones with
 the working ones
